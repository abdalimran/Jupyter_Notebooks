    "* We start the class definition with the **class** keyword, followed by the **class name** and a **colon**.\n",

    "* The first is called **\\_\\_init\\_\\_**, which is a special method. When we call the class object, a new instance of the class is created, and the **\\_\\_init\\_\\_**  method on this new object is immediately executed with all the parameters that we passed to the class object. The purpose of this method is thus to set up a new object using data that we have provided.\n",
    "* **\\_\\_init\\_\\_** is sometimes called the object’s constructor, because it is used similarly to the way that constructors are used in other languages, but that is not technically correct – it’s better to call it the initialiser. There is a different method called **\\_\\_new\\_\\_** which is more analogous to a constructor, but it is hardly ever used.\n",

This is because whenever we call a method on an object, the object itself is automatically passed in as the first parameter. This gives us a way to access the object’s properties from inside the object’s methods. In Python it is explicitly exposed and a very strongly followed convention."
